This directory tree holds a modified copy of GNU Libtasn1.  The
modifications made allow it to be built using the Emacs version of the
Android ``ndk-build'' system, in order to build a version of Emacs's
Android port with TLS support.

# Libtasn1 README -- Introduction information

This is GNU Libtasn1, a small ASN.1 library.

The C library (libtasn1.*) is licensed under the GNU Lesser General
Public License version 2.1 or later.  See the file COPYING.LIB.

The command line tool, self tests, examples, and other auxilliary
files, are licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3.0
or later.  See the file COPYING.

## Building the library

We require several tools to build the software, including:

* [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [Automake](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/) (use 1.11.3 or later)
* [Autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/)
* [Libtool](https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/)
* [Texinfo](https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/)
* [help2man](http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/)
* [Tar](https://www.gnu.org/software/tar/)
* [Gzip](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/)
* [bison](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/)
* [Texlive & epsf](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) (for PDF manual)
* [GTK-DOC](https://www.gtk.org/gtk-doc/) (for API manual)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [libabigail](https://pagure.io/libabigail/) (for abi comparison in make dist)
* [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) (optional)

The required software is typically distributed with your operating
system, and the instructions for installing them differ.  Here are
some hints:

Debian/Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install make git autoconf automake libtool bison
sudo apt-get install texinfo help2man gtk-doc-tools valgrind abigail-tools
```

PDF manual - Debian <= stretch:
```
sudo apt-get install texlive-generic-recommended texlive texlive-extra-utils
```

PDF manual - Debian >= buster:
```
sudo apt-get install texlive-plain-generic texlive texlive-extra-utils
```

The next step is to run autoreconf, ./configure, etc:

```
$ ./bootstrap
```

Then build the project normally:

```
$ ./configure
$ make check
```

Happy hacking!
